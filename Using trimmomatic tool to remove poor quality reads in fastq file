#Make sure trimmomatic-0.39 and your fastq file is in the same folder 

#Use linux environment and make sure its working environment is the folder x which has both trimmomatic tool and fastq file 

Code:java -jar trimmomatic-0.39.jar SE -threads 4 test.fastq test_trimmed.fastq TRAILING:10 -phred 33 
 



#EXPLANATION of the above code

#the above code is letting the terminal know that the trimmomatic-0.39.jar is a java file and it is in jar file format. The SE here stands for single end sequencing reads 
# The fastq file consists of single end sequencing reads and threads 4 means its using 4 CPUs for the analysis 
#test.fastq is input and test_trimmed.fastq will be the output file name. 
# Phred score is kept at 33. Which means that only those sequencing data will be retained which will have a qualoty score of 33

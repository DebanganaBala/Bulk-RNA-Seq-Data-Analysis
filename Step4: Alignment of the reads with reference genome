#Make sure HISAT2 is already downloaded and your reference genome is in the same folder
#My reference genome is in the grch38 folder which is present in my current working directory
#working directory is a folder names analysis that contains fastq file, trimmomatic tool, grch38 folder. 
#Use Linux Environment 

code: hisat2 -q --rna-strandness R -x grch38/genome -U test_trimmed.fastq | samtools sort -o test_trimmed.bam 




######################################## CODE EXPLANATION ##########################################################

# -q ->  defines input file will be in fastq format 
# --rna-strandness R -> reads are reverse stranded 
# -x -> points to the location of the reference genome 
# grch38/genome -> requesting hisat2 to use the genome file present in the grch38 folder for the alignment purpose
# test_trimmed.fastq -> name of the input file 
# | -> pipe the output of hisat2 into samtools. Then the output sam file is converted into a bam file using the sort command
# test_trimmed.bam -> self named output file
# Process takes time depending on the size of the RNA sequencing reads
